/*
ASSIGNMENT RULES
- All the answers must be written in JavaScript
- You can ask for help, reach the Teaching Assistants if needed
- You can Google / use StackOverflow BUT only when you think you need something we didn't cover during lessons yet
- You can test your code in a separate file or de-commenting the single exercises in this one.
- You can use the bash terminal, the VSCode terminal or the one embedded in your Operating System if you're using macOS or Linux.
- The solution must be available for the tutors by the end of the day (5PM CET)
*/

/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.

let typeBigInt = Infinity;

let typeBooleanT = true;

/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
*/

console.log("\nIt is a value that can be of any data type. e.g 15, random word, TRUE, undefined, null ");

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/

 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).

/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).
